## Hello, I'm Mia

I'm studying Statistics at Imperial and I really need to change my username. I enjoy looking at data related to the environment and medicine. I will be using this account for coursework, unless I start using a different account in which case I will link it here.


This is a link back to the [github main page](https://github.com/)
